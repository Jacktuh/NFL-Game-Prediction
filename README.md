## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of NFL games using historical team statistics.
Logistic Regression and Random Forest models will be implemented to predict whether the home team will win.

## Methods
- Data Source: 'nfl_data_py'
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC

## Current Status
- Repository created
- Data loading and cleaning in progress
- Feature selection and model training (next step)

## Timeline
Coming soon - following research proposal timeline.
